# Parking-Garage-Simulation
This  handles arrivals and departures in a single-lane, 10-car garage. Cars enter from the south and exit from the north. If a car to depart isn't the northernmost, cars to the north are temporarily moved and restored. The program ensures precise car handling, efficient operations, and manages  waiting line when the garage is full.
